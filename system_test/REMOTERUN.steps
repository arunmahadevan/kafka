1) Create a cluster.json file based on what Ambari has deployed. Below is the example file that you can find under system_test/ : 
 {
    "brokers": [
        "c6501.ambari.apache.org",
        "c6502.ambari.apache.org",
        "c6503.ambari.apache.org"
    ],  
    "zookeepers": [
        "c6501.ambari.apache.org"
    ],  
    "zkPort": "2181",
    "producers": [
        "c6501.ambari.apache.org",
        "c6502.ambari.apache.org"
    ],  
    "consumers": [
        "c6501.ambari.apache.org"
    ],  
    "javaHome": "/usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_40",
    "kafkaHome": "/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker",
    "secure": false
}


2) Using this cluster info file (cluster.json), update all test config files in the test suite  as follows:
 - # system_test/fixtestconfigs.py  cluster.json  system_test/replication_testsuite

3) Run the test suite.
  Update the test_to_run.json (based on which tests need to be run). Use the other test_to_run*.json sample files as reference.

  - For unsecure:
  # python -u -B system_test_runner.py 2>&1 | tee system_test_output.log

  - For secure (need to set/export SECURE in environment) :
  # SECURE="true" python -u -B system_test_runner.py 2>&1 | tee system_test_output.log
